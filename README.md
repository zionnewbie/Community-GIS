# Community-GIS

GIS- The **Community Mapping GIS** project helps communities understand local issues like pollution, infrastructure, and
resource access by visualizing them on maps. It uses open data from **NASA** and **SEDAC** to show how geography affects these issues,
empowering users to make informed decisions
 
# Our Aim
//topic was from NASA Space App Challenge 2024//
//Will try to develop ,this app// 
This project aims to create a Community Mapping GIS (Geographic Information System) app that
allows users to visualize and analyze community-related issues using geographic data. 
The application integrates mapping technologies with open data from platforms like NASA, SEDAC, 
and other GIS resources to offer spatial insights into physical geography and community concerns, 
such as food deserts or pollution impacts.

# About the Team
To create innovative and user-friendly mobile applications that empower communities to access,
contribute to, and utilize mapping data for a variety of purposes.

# About the Challenge
A geographic information system (GIS) can create, manage, analyze, and map many types of data.
With GIS and other mapping technologies, you can create a map of an area and layer open data over it spatially to reveal new, enriching insights.
Your challenge is to create a map that incorporates open science data to explore how an issue in your community is shaped by the surrounding physical geography.
Maybe you’re concerned about food deserts and want to analyze the locations of grocery stores in your neighborhood?
Or perhaps you’d like to explore the impacts of pollution on the local water supply? 
There’s so much space for opportunity—all you have to do is map it!
